# kpcom-frontend - [kamilpawlak.com](https://kamilpawlak.com) frontend web app
This is the real front-end that powers my personal portfolio site - kamilpawlak.com.
It works together with a Contentful-powered API used to retrieve content elements, like portfolio items or CV sections.

# Features ðŸš€
- Powered by React and Next.js
- Dynamic page loading
- Static site generation
- Custom design and CSS (not dependent on Bootstrap and other CSS frameworks/libraries)
- CSS Grid usage
- Design inspired by both Material and Fluent design languages
- SASS stylesheet
- Bottom navbar for easier navigations on mobile devices (shows only when the viewport width is less than 992px)
- Contentful GraphQL API for retrieving data (handled by Apollo)
